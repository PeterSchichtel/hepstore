\section{Command Line Installation}
One key idea of HepStore is simplicity. Therefore, HepStore is written
solely in Python. Rendering its installation as simple as:
%
\begin{framed}
  \begin{center}
    pip install  git+https://github.com/PeterSchichtel/hepstore.git
  \end{center}
\end{framed}
%
There are two optional arguments to the installation process:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item -{}-upgrade ~~ in case the user likes to upgrade an older installation.
\item -{}-user ~~ in case the user whishes to perform a local user installation.
\end{enumerate}
%

\section{Prerequisites}
Even though simplicity and elegance are key points of HepStore's
development strategy. There are a few packages the code relies on.
