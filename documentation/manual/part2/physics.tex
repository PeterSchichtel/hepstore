\subsection{Particles}
Let us use the same data set as above. We interpret the $(x,y)$
distribution to be the $(p_x,p_y)$ steming from particles with a comen
origin in direction. The background we identify as jets and the signal
as electrons. Let us further assume that the have different production
energies, which in addition are smeared by gaussian noise.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:example_physics} we present the invariant mass
distribution for every unique pairing of jets respectively electrons.
