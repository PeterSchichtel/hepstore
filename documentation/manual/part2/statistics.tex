\subsection{Fit a Signal}
The following Python script fits the number of background and signal
events to a given data distribution. The pdfs for fitting as well as
the data distribution are obtained from the classifier output as
presented in the previous section.

\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}{1.5cm} 
  \lstinputlisting[numbers=left,firstnumber=1,firstline=1]{../examples/core/statistics/fit.py}
\end{changemargin}

We find $9974.5$ background events and $503.2$ signal events. The true
value was $10000$ respectively $500$.

\subsection{Upper Bound on Signal Cross Section}
The following Pyhton script computes the upper bound of a possible
signal cross section given a ROC curve from some analysis.

\end{changemargin}
%
Assuming a luminosity $\mathcal{L} = 100$ and a background cross
section of $\sigma_B = 10$, we compute an upper limit on the signal
cross section of $\sigma_s \le 0.131$. We use the ROC curve obtained
in the previous section. The optimal working point is at $\epsilon_S =
39\%$, corresponding to $\epsilon_B = 0.0014$.
