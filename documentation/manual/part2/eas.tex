\subsection{List}
'hepstore-eas -L'

As this is a specific air shower framework we organise everything with
respect to the following scheme: energy -> primary particle ->
physical process -> MC generator -> nucleon model -> final state the
-{}-list argument searches for this structure and lists the following
possible contents hard events -> attempted showers -> showeres ->
observables

\subsection{Generation}

'hepstore-eas -G'

we interface from the hepstore.docker family (more details in
appendix) and provide automated runcards for herwig to produce events
which may be showerd by corsika

\subsubsection{Nucleon Modle}

we provide two nucleon models 'full' and 'fragmented'

\subsection{Shower}

'hepstore-eas -S'

we interface from the hepstore.docker family and provide automated
runcards for corsika to either shower events generted with '-G' or
produce corsika stand alone showers (internal corsika di-jet
production) when using '-C 7.4' (here 7.4 is the version vor the
docker image)

\subsection{Observables}

'hepstore-eas -A'

we provide our own event class to read corsika produced extended air
showers. inspired by rivet we allow for dynamic load of user analysis
modules and provide one example for such, constructing $\rho_\mu$ and
$X_\text{max}$. hepstore-eas automatically provides its output in .npy
format
